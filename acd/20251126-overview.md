# OpenKCM

**OpenKCM** (Open Key Chain Management) is the **revenue catalyst** that transforms cryptographic sovereignty into a high-margin, enterprise-winning capability for SaaS platforms.

Enterprises and governments require **true data ownership** — beyond IAM controls or shared-key compromises. OpenKCM delivers precisely that: customer root-key control combined with enterprise-grade speed, scale, and security.

### Clean Separation of Concerns

- **CMK Service** → Customer Governance & Sovereignty Layer  
  The customer-facing trust anchor where **L1 root keys** remain exclusively in the customer’s own KMS/HSM account (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS, OpenBao, private HSMs).

- **Crypto Service** → Operations & Execution Layer  
  The high-performance engine (Core Crypto + Crypto Edge) that manages **L2 (Tenant), L3 (Service), and L4 (Data Encryption) keys** — protecting tenant data with sub-millisecond latency at massive scale.

### Business Asymmetry Created

- Provider **never holds plaintext root keys** → instant liability reduction
- Customer **revokes access anytime** → mathematically enforced sovereignty
- Platform stays **cloud-agnostic & high-performance** → no lock-in, no slowdowns

###  Strategic Business Advantages

| Advantage                     | Business Meaning                                      | Revenue / Market Win                                      |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Market Expansion**          | Opens Government, Finance, Defense, Healthcare        | High-ACV enterprise & sovereign-cloud deals               |
| **Liability Shift**           | No plaintext root keys → breach firewall              | Lower insurance premiums & legal exposure                 |
| **Pricing Leverage**          | Full BYOK/HYOK + revocation as Platinum tier          | 30–60% higher ACV on premium plans                        |
| **Competitive Moat**          | True cryptographic isolation + multi-cloud native     | Wins RFPs vs. legacy shared-key providers                 |
| **Operational Efficiency**    | Automated L2–L4 lifecycle + edge-scale performance    | Lower support cost, higher gross margins                  |
| **Compliance Acceleration**   | End-to-end traceability & audit logs                  | Faster sales cycles & regulatory approvals                |

### Key Promises to Customers & Regulators

- **Zero-trust multi-tenancy** — data mathematically siloed in shared infrastructure
- **Verifiable revocation** — customer disables root key → instant loss of decryption
- **Multi-cloud freedom** — AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenBao, Thales, Fortanix, private HSMs
- **Enterprise performance** — billions of operations/day, sub-ms latency
- **Audit-ready transparency** — full correlation to customer KMS logs

OpenKCM is **not** just a key management system — it is a **revenue engine** that:

- Opens the most regulated, highest-paying markets
- Reduces provider risk and operational complexity
- Turns security into a **premium, high-margin feature**
- Future-proofs for sovereign, hybrid, and multi-cloud realities

## The CMK Layer: Governance & Trust
The **CMK Layer** (Customer Managed Key) is the **customer-facing governance engine** of OpenKCM — the strategic interface that turns cryptographic key ownership into a **measurable business and compliance advantage**.

This layer is deliberately isolated from internal operations, ensuring that:

- Customers **retain full control** over their root encryption keys (L1 CMK)
- The SaaS provider **never possesses plaintext root keys**
- Revocation is **instant and mathematically enforced**
- Audit trails are **end-to-end traceable** back to the customer’s own KMS logs

In short: the CMK Layer is the **trust firewall** that lets enterprises adopt your SaaS platform with confidence — and lets you sell **sovereignty as a premium capability**.

### Core Business Value Delivered by the CMK Layer

| Value Driver                        | How the CMK Layer Enables It                                      | Direct Business Impact                                      |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Customer Data Sovereignty**       | L1 keys remain exclusively in customer’s KMS/HSM account          | Meets “must-have” clauses in enterprise RFPs & contracts    |
| **Instant Revocation Capability**   | Customer disables/deletes L1 key → provider immediately loses decryption ability | Verifiable compliance with GDPR Art. 32, Schrems II, DORA   |
| **Liability & Breach Protection**   | Provider never sees plaintext root keys — only encrypted references | Lower cyber-insurance premiums, reduced legal exposure      |
| **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Freedom**    | Native support for AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS, OpenBao, Thales, Fortanix, private HSMs | Wins “cloud-agnostic” and sovereign-cloud deals             |
| **Audit & Transparency Leadership** | Full correlation IDs linking every operation to customer KMS logs | Dramatically faster & easier customer security audits       |

### Key Capabilities of the CMK Layer

- **Customer Self-Service BYOK/HYOK Onboarding**  
  Enterprises import their existing keys or create new ones in their own cloud accounts — no manual provider involvement required.

- **Tenant-to-Key Mapping & Policy Enforcement**  
  Securely maps tenant IDs to customer-specific KMS references (ARNs, key URIs, aliases) with fine-grained authorization checks.

- **Envelope Wrapping/Unwrapping Orchestration**  
  Coordinates secure wrapping of internal L2 tenant keys using customer L1 CMKs — all operations logged and auditable.

- **Pluggable Keystore Drivers**  
  One unified interface supports all major enterprise-grade keystores and HSMs — future-proof and vendor-neutral.

- **End-to-End Audit Trail**  
  Every cryptographic action generates correlation IDs traceable from internal logs → CMK Layer → customer KMS audit logs.

- **Revocation & Emergency Kill-Switch**  
  Customer-initiated revocation instantly renders all tenant data inaccessible to the provider — no recovery path exists.

### Strategic Positioning & Market Differentiation

- **Not “customer-managed IAM roles”** — true cryptographic root-key control
- **Not “shared master key with customer opt-in”** — customer revocation is absolute and irreversible
- **Not vendor-locked** — works equally well with AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenBao, or private HSMs
- **Not a compliance checkbox** — becomes a **revenue driver** through Platinum-tier pricing and enterprise deal velocity


##  The Crypto Layer: Operational
The **Crypto Layer** (Crypto Service) is the **invisible powerhouse** of OpenKCM — the internal execution engine responsible for protecting all tenant data with uncompromising performance and reliability.

While the CMK Layer handles customer trust and sovereignty, the Crypto Layer delivers the **operational reality**: billions of cryptographic operations per day, sub-millisecond latency, zero-downtime key lifecycle management, and seamless multi-region consistency.

This layer ensures that **security never slows down the product** — users experience fast, responsive applications even under massive load, while the platform maintains the highest cryptographic standards.

  Handles rotation, versioning, archiving, and retirement of internal L2 (tenant) and L3 (service) keys with zero downtime and zero manual steps.

- **MasterKey Unsealing & Protection**  
  Reconstructs the internal MasterKey (via Seal auto-unseal or SSS) into secure memory only — never persisted in plaintext.

- **Policy & Authorization Enforcement**  
  Validates tenant ↔ service mappings before any key operation — prevents unauthorized access even internally.

- **Multi-Region Reconciliation**  
  Orbital engine automatically synchronizes encrypted key metadata and tenant schemas across geographic regions — eventual consistency without complexity.

#### Crypto Edge – Distributed High-Throughput Engine

- **Ultra-Low Latency Operations**  
  Deployed as lightweight sidecars or dedicated pods right next to application databases and workloads — sub-millisecond DEK (Data Encryption Key) generation and use.

- **Independent Horizontal Scaling**  
  Scales out effortlessly to absorb demand spikes without impacting Core Crypto or user-facing latency.

- **Ephemeral L4 DEKs**  
  Generates short-lived Data Encryption Keys locally — used once per operation and discarded or briefly cached — no persistent storage overhead.

- **KMIP/mTLS Communication**  
  All Edge ↔ Core interactions use standardized KMIP 1.4 over mandatory mutual TLS — secure, interoperable, and auditable.


### Strategic Positioning & Operational Differentiation

- **Not centralized crypto gateway** — no single-point bottleneck or failure mode
- **Not performance trade-off** — security at full application speed
